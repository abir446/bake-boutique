*Bake Boutique*
step-1: Clone the repo either by command or by using github desktop
step-2: Wait for instructions
step-3: If one task assigned, create a seperate branch with a meaningful name. Change only the required files (if confused, ask the owner).
step-4: Push into that specific brach and add me as a reviewer.
step-5: If further changes required, will notify you, otherwise, will merge the branch into master branch.

Happy Coding!
